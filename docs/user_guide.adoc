== REST API

Crux currently has a small REST API that allows one to use Crux in a
more conventional SaaS way, deploying Kafka and query nodes into AWS
and interact with Crux over HTTP. This mode does not support all
features.

The REST API provides the following paths: `/document`, `/history`,
`/query` for reads and `/tx-log` for writes. When using the REST API the
user doesnâ€™t interact directly with Kafka, but calls one of the query
nodes (potentially behind a load balancer) over HTTP to interact with
Crux. As the query nodes might be at different points in the index, and
different queries might go to differnet nodes, there are currently some
read consistency issues that can arise here.

The REST API also provides an experimental end point for SPARQL 1.1
Protocol queries under `/sparql/`. Only a small subset of SPARQL is
supported, and is working by rewriting the query into the Crux datalog
dialect and there are no further RDF features by using this.

=== Single Node

Crux can also be run on a single node without Kafka as a pure library.
One aim is to be able to use the same library at vastly different sizes
of deployments.

== K/V Store

Supported KV stores are RocksDB, LMDB and an in-memory store.
