== Setup

=== REST API

Crux currently has a small REST API that allows one to use Crux in a
more conventional SaaS way, deploying Kafka and query nodes into AWS
and interact with Crux over HTTP. This mode does not support all
features.

=== Single Node

Crux can also be run on a single node without Kafka as a pure library.
One aim is to be able to use the same library at vastly different sizes
of deployments.

== K/V Store

Supported KV stores are RocksDB, LMDB and an in-memory store.
