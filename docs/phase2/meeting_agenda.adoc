= Phase 2 Meeting agenda

== Discussion points

I will add a lot of discussion points on the agenda.
There will not be time to discuss everything for to long
so we will have to strike things and push back things as we
go trough discussion points. Some points might not need to be
discussed after we gone trough some of the points (or we have picked a direction already).

But the last discussion point "Define scope for face2" has to be
reached by the end of these meetings. And has to be given enough
time.
