== Known Issues

* Rules in queries are not well tested.
* Nested expressions in queries are not well tested.
* Point in time semantics when writing in the past.
* Documents requires `:crux.db/id` which removes ability to share
versions across entities.
* Potential of inconsistent reads across different nodes when using REST
API.
* Architecture not tested in real application use.
* Lazy results requires consistent sorting across indexes. which has to
be performed during the query.
* The query engine is not optimised and constructs a lot of intermediate
structures.
