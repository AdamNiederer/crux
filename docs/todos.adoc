== Document TODOs

This is an incomplete order of things to do, to get the Crux docs in a
good shape for general usage.

* Correct links after mvp->introduction
* Remove legacy strategy A vs B etc, possibly all of internals.adoc in favour of implmentation.adoc
* Remove internal documents such as business model
* Update the styling to align with JUXT/tick
* Document AWS deployment
