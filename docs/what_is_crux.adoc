= What is Crux?

Crux is an unbundled bi-temporal graph database.

== Unbundled

Crux - to use Martin Kleppmannâ€™s phrase -is is an _unbundled_
database. It's a database turned inside out, using:

* Apache Kafka for the primary store and semi-immutable log.
* RocksDB or LMDB to host indices for rich query support.

== Bitemporality

Crux is a bitemporal database, storing both business and
transaction time. This enables corrections in business time at a later
transaction time. <<bitemp.adoc#,Read more about Bitemporality in Crux.>>

== Query

Crux supports a Datalog query interface for reads. Queries are
executed so that the results are lazily streamed from the underlying
indices.

== Eviction

Crux supports eviction of past data, to play nicely with GDRP and
similar concerns.

The main transaction log contains only hashes and is immutable. The
content data itself is stored in a secondary document topic that can
be evicted by compaction.
