== What is Crux?

Crux is an unbundled bi-temporal graph database.

=== Unbundled

* Apache Kafka is used as the primary store and semi-immutable log.
* Local Key/Value store such as RocksDB and LMDB is used to host
indices for rich query support.

=== Bitemporality

Crux is also a bitemporal database, storing both business and
transaction time. This enables corrections in business time at a later
transaction time.
