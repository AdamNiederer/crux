= What is Crux?

Crux is an unbundled bi-temporal graph database.

== Unbundled

Crux - to use Martin Kleppmannâ€™s phrase -is is an _unbundled_
database. It's a database turned inside out, using:

* Apache Kafka for the primary store and semi-immutable log.
* RocksDB or LMDB to host indices for rich query support.

== Bitemporality

Crux is a bitemporal database, storing both business and
transaction time. This enables corrections in business time at a later
transaction time. <<bitemp.adoc#,Read more about Bitemporality in Crux.>>
