== What is Crux?

Crux is an unbundled bitemporal graph database:

* Apache Kafka is used as the primary store and semi-immutable log.
* Local Key/Value store such as RocksDB and LMDB is used to host
indices for rich query support.

////
The above isn't strictly true, as Kafka can be swapped out in a local
node setup.
